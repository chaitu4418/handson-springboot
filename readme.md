######Notes:
1. After I've been reading about it and seeing some presentations I came to the conclusion spring boot is a great project and is likely to make the life of the java enterprise developer a lot easier (more time for the family).
1. It is based on maven (but probably, if I consider I am familiar enough with gradle, I will use gradle instead)
1. I know the packaging should be grouped based on functionality rather than the frameworks/architecture related stuff. But, until I have a good business model I'll go with the frameworks/arch based one.
