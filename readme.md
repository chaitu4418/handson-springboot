### This project is about the spring boot, the latest buzz in the spring community.

######What I would like to use in this project (which I would like to consider the starting point for any technical assignment;) 
1. Spring data (JPA)
1. Spring data rest
1. Spring Couchbase
1. Spring Cassandra
1. Spring webmvc
1. Thymeleaf (template engine - html)
1. Spring cache (JSR-107 JCache, Hazelcast)
1. Validation (JSR-303)
1. Messaging AMQP
1. 

######Notes:
1. After I've been reading about it and seeing some presentations I came to the conclusion spring boot is a great project and is likely to make the life of the java enterprise developer a lot easier (more time for the family).
